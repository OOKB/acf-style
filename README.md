A Custom Layout for some modular features using the CAPE ecosystem of site building tools and modules.

"Layout" refers to just the images and CSS necessary for designing/laying out a site in the CAPE/EZLE ecosystem. The HTML is produced within the various CAPE apps, and stays basically the same for all sites using this system. Design/Layout is done solely through clever use of CSS.
